                    <p id="about">Born Nasir Jones, in Queens, New York, on September 14, 1973, Nas is the son of jazz musician Olu Dara. He was raised in the Queensbridge Houses, a huge housing project, where he wrote stories about what it was like growing up in the projects. Despite his interest in writing, Nas dropped out of school while in eighth grade, and his life on the mean streets of New York City would fuel a new breed of writing: rap lyrics.<br/>
                    
                    Born in New York City in 1971, Tupac Shakur, known by his stage name 2Pac, was an American rapper. Shakur has sold more than 75 million albums worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists in the world. Most of Tupac's songs are about growing up amid violence and hardship in ghettos, racism, other social problems and conflicts with other rappers during the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry.<br/>
                    
                    Born as Christopher Wallace on May 21, 1972, in Brooklyn, New York, Biggie Smalls, also known as Notorious B.I.G. He started experimenting with music as a teenager and, not long after, befriended Sean "Puffy" Combs. His 1994 debut album, Ready to Die, was a smash hit, and his long-running feud with fellow rapper, Tupac Shakur, helped to shape his career.
